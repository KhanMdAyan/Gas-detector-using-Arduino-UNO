# Gas-detector-using-Arduino-UNO
This is a simple project to detect Gas. For this project we have used Arduino Uno to keep it as simple as possible. All the files related to this project are here, including a video of the simulation. As for the process of uploading to the board or simulating in Proteus, you will have to look it up online, it is fairly simple. You are free to use the files, just don't forget to give it a star.
